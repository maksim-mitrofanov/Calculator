# Calculator
Many programmers write hello world as their first program in a new programming language. <br />  I decided to extend this logic, and so I made something basic using Swift and SwiftUI.

### Goals ✨
- Design an attractive calculator UI, that adapts to **portrait** and **landscape** orientation.
- Wride code so each part of the app can be easily **extended** and **modified**. 

### Things I learned 🔭
- How to add / change / sync app theme with device colorScheme.
- Using UISizeClass to determine device orientation and updating UI according to orientation changes.
- Embedding Lottie animations into SwiftUI View.
- Animating drag gestures.
- Storing values in UserDefaults for data persistence.
- Data persistance (saving data to device using FileManager).
- Using SoundManager and HapticsManager.
- Chanding preferredColorScheme according to selected theme.
- Presenting custom alerts.
- Using transitions.
- Swipe actions.

### Extra 🤩
- The UI was first made and tested in Figma.
- The app icon was also made in Figma.
