# Calculator
Many programmers write hello world as their first program in a new programming language. <br />  I decided to extend this logic, and so I made something basic using Swift and SwiftUI.

## Goals
- Design an attractive calculator UI, that adapts to **portrait** and **landscape** orientation.
- Make a fully functional code, divided by basic OOP, so each part of the app can be easily **extended** and **modified**. 

### Thing I learned
- How to add / change / sync app theme to system theme.
- Using UISizeClass to determite device orientation and updating UI according to orientation changes.
- Embedding lottie animations into SwiftUI View.
- Animating drag gestures using padding.
- Storing values in UserDefaults for data persistence.

### Extra
- The UI was first made and tested in Figma.
- The app icon was also made in figma.
